Zyflo CLI is a command line interface tool that helps you to create a new Zyflo project. It is a simple tool that allows you to create a new project with a single command. The CLI tool is designed to be easy to use and provides a range of options to customize your project. Using the CLI, you can create a new Zyflo project with just a few commands.

## Under Development
The CLI is still under development. It is currently at a very early stage of development and is not yet ready for production use. However, we are actively working on it and we will make it available soon. Stay tuned for updates.
