Welcome to **Zyflo**, an animated UI library to create beautiful and accessible web application interfaces with a variety of interactive elements. Zyflo is meant to nurture flow and fluidity so developers can create visually appealing, fast interactions effortlessly. Whether it is an intricate animation or just some UI effects, Zyflo makes you comfortable with blending amazing UI elements to your already running projects without causing any harm in performance which enhance the user engagement. Using Zyflo, every part of your UI becomes a fluid continuum. 

## Why Zyflo?

Building Zyflo has always been a personal project for me as this is something I have longed to do: creating my own UI library. I think the idea of creating something that would enable others to build beautiful UIs felt really awesome. This project was inspired by the **amazing work** of <a href="manuarora.in" target="_blank">Manu Arora</a> with <a href="https://ui.aceternity.com" target="_blank">AceternityUI</a> and <a href="https://shadcn.com" target="_blank">Shadcn</a> with <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com" target="_blank">shadcnUI</a>. Manu and Shadcn both are the reason why I started getting into front-end design in depth and their design work has been a lot of inspiration for how Zyflo is developed. 

## Current Status

Zyflo is still actively being developed, much more is to come. The basis is made, and we are actively working towards enhancing and cleaning up the library to give it more and better life.

## The Approach

The basic idea we follow is similar to how <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com" target="_blank">shadcnUI</a> and <a href="https://ui.aceternity.com" target="_blank">Aceternity UI</a> work. We use Tailwind CSS to style the components and provide a set of pre-defined variants for each component. This allows you to easily customize the appearance and functionality of the components based on your requirements.

The idea is to copy and paste our components directly into your project and customize them as per your requirements. We have also provided a set of pre-defined variants for each component, which you can use to customize the appearance and functionality of the components based on your requirements.

The advantage of following this approach is that you do not need to include any addition NodeJS packages or other dependencies in your project. You can simply copy and paste our components into your project, along with the required config files and customize them as per your requirements. This approach also allows you to easily integrate our components into your existing project without any conflicts.
